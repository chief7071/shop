		<h1>About us</h1>

		<p>Flowers <strong>&quot;From The Chief&quot;</strong> was created on <strong>July 25th, 2018</strong></p>
		<p>Artem Fominov has proudly held the position of President since 2018, developing the business over time to become the premier <strong>online flower delivery</strong> service in the area. </p>
		<p>Flowers From The chief Shopâ€™s florists can help you select from our wide variety of fresh cut flowers, beautiful flowering plants as well as green plants, fruit and gourmet baskets. We offer three different price
			packages: standard, deluxe, and premium. The price of an arrangement is determined by the quality, the number and variety of flowers plus the size and/or the cost of the container.</p>
		<p>For an arrangement or bouquet of a single flower variety such as roses, "Premium" includes stems of a supporting blossom such as babies breath, wax flower, heather or aster.</p>
		<p>At East City Flower Shop, we believe there is a fresh bouquet/arrangement or gift basket for every budget. If you wish to spend more or less, simply Our professional design staff will give you valuable suggestions and viable alternatives. Please ask
			us about our flower delivery services.</p>
		<h2>Our Professional Qualifications</h2>
		<p> In 2018, Artem became Canada's eighth Canadian Accredited Master Florist, having successfully completed exams in both floral design and floral management. </p>
		<p>Because of our close association with FTD we are able to send any of these items around the corner or around the world. Dutch and <strong>Exotic flowers </strong>are always in abundance; Creative and imaginative designs are commonplace.</p>
		<p>The friendly staff is always available to make suggestions and educated recommendations. East City Flower Shop is also an active community supporter and participate actively in Flowers Canada. Quality flowers, friendly service and knowledgeable staff
			make it easy to choose East City Flower Shop for moments when you care.</p>
		<h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
		<p>We strive to ensure that every product we sell is of both the freshest and the very best quality we can purchase. However, our floral products are perishable and are affected by factors such as temperature, storage conditions, seasonality and regional
			availability.
		</p>
